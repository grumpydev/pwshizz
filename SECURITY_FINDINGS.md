# üîí Security Penetration Testing Report

## Executive Summary

**Assessment Date**: Current  
**Tester**: Elite White Hat Security Researcher  
**Target System**: ShareDo Application (core1-release.sharedo.co.uk)  
**Assessment Type**: Automated Security Testing with Playwright  

## üö® Critical Findings

### 1. **Session Security Vulnerabilities** - HIGH RISK
**Finding**: Session cookies lack proper security attributes
- **Issue**: `httpOnly` flag not set on session cookies
- **Risk**: Vulnerable to XSS-based session hijacking
- **Evidence**: Session cookie accessible via JavaScript
- **Recommendation**: Set `httpOnly=true` and `secure=true` on all session cookies

### 2. **HTTPS Enforcement Weakness** - HIGH RISK  
**Finding**: HTTP connections not properly redirected to HTTPS
- **Issue**: HTTP requests allowed without forced HTTPS redirect
- **Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, credential interception
- **Evidence**: `http://core1-release.sharedo.co.uk/` accessible
- **Recommendation**: Implement HSTS headers and force HTTPS redirects

### 3. **CSRF Protection Missing** - MEDIUM RISK
**Finding**: No CSRF tokens detected in authentication forms
- **Issue**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection absent
- **Risk**: Unauthorized actions via malicious websites
- **Evidence**: No CSRF tokens found in login form
- **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations

## ‚úÖ Security Controls That Passed

### Authentication Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: ‚úÖ PASSED
  - All SQL injection payloads properly rejected
  - No authentication bypass achieved
  - System remained secure against database attacks

- **XSS Prevention**: ‚úÖ PASSED  
  - All XSS payloads properly sanitized
  - No script execution achieved
  - Input validation working correctly

- **Credential Stuffing Protection**: ‚úÖ PASSED
  - Common credential combinations rejected
  - No unauthorized access gained
  - Account security maintained

### Authorization Controls
- **Direct URL Access Prevention**: ‚úÖ PASSED
  - Post-logout URL access properly blocked
  - Users redirected to login page
  - Session invalidation working

- **Clickjacking Protection**: ‚úÖ PASSED
  - X-Frame-Options header present
  - Iframe embedding prevented

### Input Validation
- **Malformed Request Handling**: ‚úÖ PASSED (with notes)
  - System gracefully handles malformed inputs
  - No crashes or errors exposed
  - Proper validation in place

## üîß Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Enable secure session cookie attributes**
   ```http
   Set-Cookie: sessionid=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
   ```

2. **Implement HTTPS enforcement**
   ```http
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   ```

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)
3. **Add CSRF protection**
   - Implement CSRF tokens in all forms
   - Validate tokens server-side
   - Use SameSite cookie attributes

4. **Enhance session management**
   - Regenerate session IDs after login
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Clear session data on logout

### Long-term Monitoring
5. **Implement security headers**
   ```http
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   ```

6. **Add brute force protection**
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Rate limiting on login endpoints
   - CAPTCHA for repeated failures

## üìä Risk Assessment

**Overall Security Score**: 7/10
- **Strengths**: Strong input validation, proper authentication logic
- **Weaknesses**: Session security, transport security, CSRF protection
- **Priority**: Focus on session and transport layer security

## üõ°Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Address critical findings immediately
2. Implement monitoring for security events
3. Regular security testing schedule
4. Security awareness training for development team
5. Consider penetration testing by external security firm
